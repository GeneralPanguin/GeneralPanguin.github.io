## About Me

Hi! Welcome to my website. My name is Aoxuan Wang. (Btw, the pronunciation of 'Aoxuan' is similar to 'Ocean'.) I have strong interest in combining machine learning with finance, and I am seeking any PhD position relating to this domain. My master dissertation is also about this – applying machine learning to analyse American option pricing.

What make me pride most is my self-learning ability. I passed CFA level 2 and all ACCA tests, all by self-study. I also self-learned some language, such as Japanese (Luckily, my Japanese ability could support me to communicate with local people when I was in Japan), Germany, Russia, Latin and Greek. I enjoy the process of learning, and thanks to Internet, much knowledge are easy to access now. Using internet and online university, I have safaried in sociology, history, astrology, programming, mathematic, psychology and so on.

I also like do exercise. My favorite sport is fitness.
